Purpose: This assignment is designed to demonstrate your
understanding of arrays.
Assignment Description:
A small airline has just purchased a computer for its new automated reservations system.
You have just been asked to program the new system. You are to write a Java application
to assign seats on each flight of the airline's only plane.
The seats on the plane will be numbered 0 through 9 to correspond to the indexes of the
array. You should display a list of all available seats, then ask the user which seat s(he)
wishes to reserve a seat on the plane. The application should assign the requested seat and
display a message indicating the user's seat number. Continue assigning seats until all
seats are filled.
Your application should, of course never assign a seat that has already been assigned.
When the plane is full, display a message stating that no seats are available The program
should then stop execution.
 Hints:
Create an array to represent the 10 seats on the plane.
Initialize all elements to 0 to indicate that no seats are taken.
When a seat is filled, store another character other than 0 in that element.
Continue looping through this process until all seats are assigned.
