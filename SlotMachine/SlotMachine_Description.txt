Objective: Work with classes as reusable code and random numbers.
Instructions: A slot machine is a device that the user inserts money into and then
pulls a lever (or presses a button). The slot machine then displays a set of random
images. If two or more of the images match, the user wins an amount that the slot
machine dispenses back to the user.
Create a Java program that simulates a slot machine. When the program runs it
should do the following:
1. Asks the user to enter the amount of money he or she wishes to enter into
the slot machine.
2. Instead of displaying images, have the program display the name of the
image. The program must randomly select a word from the following list:
Cherries, Oranges, Plums, Bells, Melons, Bars
To select a word, the program can generate a random number in the range of
0 to 5. If the number is 0, the selected word is Cherries, if the number is 1,
then the selected word is Oranges, and so forth. The program should
randomly select a word from the list 3 times and display all 3 of the words.
3. If none of the randomly selected words match, the program informs the
user that he or she has won $0. If 2 of the words match, the program
informs the user of the amount (2 times the amount entered) that he or she
has won. If 3 of the words match, the program informs the user of the
amount (3 times the amount entered) that he or she has won.
4. The program asks if the user wants to play again. If so, these steps are
repeated. If not, the program displays the total amount of money entered
into the slot machine and the total amount won.
You should create a main (driver) class and name it Slot.java. Additionally, you
should create a programmer-defined class named Machine.java. The simulation of
the slot machine (steps 2 through 3) should be coded in the Machine class. Step 4
should be coded in the main class named Slot.java. You may code step 1 in either
Slot.java or Machine.java depending on the way you design the program.**/
