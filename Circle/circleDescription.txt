/**
Purpose: This assignment is designed to learn the basics of object oriented programming.
Assignment Description:
 Write a Circle class that has the following fields:
 Radius : a double
 PI: a final double initialized with the value 3.14159
 This Circle class should have the following methods:
 Constructor. Accepts the radius of the circle as an argument.
 setRadius. A mutator (setter) method for the radius field.
 getRadius. An accessor (getter) method for the radius field.
 getArea. Returns the area of the circle, which is calculated as
area = PI * radius * radius
 getDiameter. Returns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as
diameter = radius * 2
 getCircumference. Returns the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as
 circumference = 2 * PI * radius
Write a program (CircleDemo) that demonstrates the Circle class by asking the user for the
circle's radius, creating a Circle object, and then reporting the circle's area, diameter, and
circumference.
Submission: There will be two .java files to be submitted through Moodle. These will be named
CircleDemo.java (the driver or main class) and Circle.java (the programmer-defined class). **/
