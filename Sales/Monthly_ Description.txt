/**
Program Description: A Java program is to be created to do a monthly
sales analysis for the Great Buy Company.
To process the program, the programmer should read the file of Monthly sales amounts (Monthly.txt). It
will be best to store this data in parallel arrays to ensure quick processing of the analysis. The
programmer should produce a report giving the following statistics:
 The total sales amount for the month
 The average sales amount per salesman for the month
 The lowest sales amount for the month along with that salesman’s name
 The highest sales amount for the month along with that salesman’s name
 A list of all salesmen selling more than the average amount
 A list of all salesmen selling less than the average amount
Ask for the name of the input file in the main programmer-defined class. This way the class can be
reused to do analysis of other files.
Input: The salesmen’s names and their monthly sales amount are stored in a file named Monthly.txt.
Each line of the file contains a name and an amount of sales as shown below:
Joe Smith 12000.89
Ann Rodgers 20987.65
Output: You may design your output as you think best but be sure to label all fields appropriately.**/
